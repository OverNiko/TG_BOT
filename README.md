2. Echo - it repeats everything the user has written, also it includes a filter of bad words (only Russian words);
3. Weather - you can find out the weather in any place, wherever you are :);
4. ChatGPT - chat with ChatGPT directly from Telegram chat :);
5. Cancel - cancel certain interactions with the Telegram bot, e.g. stop chatting with ChatGPT.
